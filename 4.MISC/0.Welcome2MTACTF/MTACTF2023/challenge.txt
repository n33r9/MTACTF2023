After you find the weak password, your next challenge is to find the stronger password in the flag.zip file. Specifically, that password is made according to 4 requirements as follows:
1. Your password must include a number (1-6)
2. Your password must include an uppercase letter (A-O)
3. Your password must include a special character (one of the special characters !@#$)
4. The digits in your password must add up to 25.
Based on the above requirements, find a password that meets all four of the above in the passwordlists.txt file to enter the flag.zip file to get the flag.
